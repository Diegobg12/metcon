## Description 

Metcon Club is a Crossfit Gym located in Bogot√°-Colombia. They were looking for a design that focused more on the company values, 
by sharing their message with simple images and impact content. The design covers the client expectations, and the idea to build an 
informative website in WordPress was to allow the client to change their content as their convenience, and let open the possibility 
to create a blog page to share their daily activity.  To make this possible, I used tools like Mpn-Gulp, Sass, JavaScript (J-query).
